## Abstract

This SNIP aims to introduce interface support checks for [SNIP-2](snip-2.md) token transfers that prevent potential token loss caused by the sender transferring tokens to an empty address or a contract that does not properly acknowledge inbound [SNIP-2](snip-2.md) token transfers.

## Motivation

With the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions and counterintuitive format of addresses, too many financial assets are lost on a daily basis due to user error such as address typos. [SNIP-3](snip-3.md) already recognizes this issue and has a built-in safe transfer function that ensures the recipient acknowledges the inbound token transfer. There is no reason why this mechanism doesn't exist for [SNIP-2](snip-2.md).

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

_"ERC-20" is used interchangeably with "SNIP-2" due to its prevalence within the Starknet ecosystem._

The [SNIP-17](snip-17.md) receiver interface ID MUST be defined as follows:

```cairo
/// Extended function selector as defined in SRC-5
const ISNIP17_RECEIVER_ID: felt252 = selector!("fn_on_erc20_received(ContractAddress,ContractAddress,u256,Span<felt252>)->felt252)");
```

An [SNIP-17](snip-17.md)-compliant [SNIP-2](snip-2.md)/ERC-20 token contract MUST:

- Implement `safe_transfer_from` as shown in the code snippet below.
- When performing a safe transfer, call `on_erc20_received` or `onERC20Received` on the recipient and compare the return value against the [SNIP-17](snip-17.md) interface ID. If there is a mismatch, the transfer has failed. Revert, return false, or perform any other appropriate actions for failed token transfers.

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait ISNIP17Contract<TContractState> {
    fn safeTransferFrom(
        ref self: TContractState,
        sender: ContractAddress,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
        amount: u256,
        data: Span<felt252>
    );
    fn safe_transfer_from(
        ref self: TContractState,
        sender: ContractAddress,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
        amount: u256,
        data: Span<felt252>
    );
}
```

An [SNIP-17](snip-17.md)-compliant [SNIP-2](snip-2.md)/ERC-20 token recipient MUST satisfy one of the following criteria:

- Through [SNIP-5](snip-5.md), self-identify as an account with an [SNIP-6](snip-6.md) interface ID.
- Through [SNIP-5](snip-5.md), confirm support for [SNIP-17](snip-17.md) interface ID and implement the following `ISNIP17Receiver` trait.

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait ISNIP17Receiver<TContractState> {
    fn on_erc20_received(
        self: @TContractState,
        operator: ContractAddress,
        from: ContractAddress,
        amount: u256,
        data: Span<felt252>
    ) -> felt252;

    fn onERC20Received(
        self: @TContractState,
        operator: ContractAddress,
        from: ContractAddress,
        amount: u256,
        data: Span<felt252>
    ) -> felt252;
}
```

## Rationale

This SNIP draws inspiration from [EIP-4524](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4524). [EIP-1363](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363) was also considered, but ultimately decided keeping the API consistent with existing safe transfer mechanisms is more important.

## Backwards Compatibility

This SNIP is incompatible with existing [SNIP-2](snip-2.md)/ERC-20 contracts as the specification requires the addition of new functions and logic through an upgrade.

Legacy unupgradeable recipients are incompatible with this SNIP and requires transferring tokens using the existing unsafe `transfer` function.

## Reference Implementation

Below is a snippet of an OpenZeppelin-based example implementation of this SNIP:

```cairo
fn safe_transfer_from(
    ref self: ContractState,
    sender: ContractAddress,
    recipient: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    data: Span<felt252>,
) {
    self.erc20.transfer_from(sender, recipient, amount);
    if !self._check_on_erc20_received(sender, recipient, amount, data) {
        self._throw_invalid_receiver(recipient);
    }
}

fn _check_on_erc20_received(
    self: @ContractState,
    sender: ContractAddress,
    recipient: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    data: Span<felt252>,
) -> bool {
    let src5_dispatcher = ISRC5Dispatcher { contract_address: recipient };
    if src5_dispatcher.supports_interface(ISNIP17_RECEIVER_ID) {
        ISNIP17ReceiverDispatcher { contract_address: recipient }
            .on_erc20_received(
                get_caller_address(), sender, amount, data
            ) == ISNIP17_RECEIVER_ID
    } else {
        src5_dispatcher.supports_interface(ISRC6_ID)
    }
}

/// SNIP-64 error standard
fn _throw_invalid_receiver(self: @ContractState, receiver: ContractAddress) {
    let data: Array<felt252> = array!['ERC20InvalidReceiver', receiver.into(),];
    panic(data);
}
```

## Security Considerations

As with calling any external contract, calling this receive hook may result in reentrancy attacks. Use proper design patterns and/or reentrancy guards if needed.
